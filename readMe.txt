CODE /

    npm run dev 
        = to run dev server 

    cmd + d 
        = to enable multi curser editing 

TIPS / 

    components / sections of your app = cannot return more than one element ( so wrap everything in a container ) 
        - / cmd shft p > wrap with abbrev. > div > enter
    
    *** multiple components need to be wrapped together under a div as a child ***
    
    the Fragment tag or am empty open and close tag works / <Fragment></Fragment> / <></> / 
        - both are telling react that this is will one component
